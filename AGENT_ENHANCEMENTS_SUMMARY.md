# Agent Description Enhancements Summary

All 10 agent descriptions in `LAZY_DEV/.claude/agents/` have been enhanced with **proactive triggers** following Anthropic's best practices pattern from RESEARCH_REPORT.md.

## Pattern Applied

```yaml
---
name: agent-name
description: Clear, action-oriented description. Use PROACTIVELY when [trigger].
tools: Tool1, Tool2
model: sonnet
---
```

## Changes Made

### 1. project-manager.md
- **Before**: `Create comprehensive US-story and TASKS from feature brief. Use immediately after /lazy create-feature.`
- **After**: `Create comprehensive US-story and TASKS from feature brief. Use PROACTIVELY when user provides a feature brief or requests story creation.`
- **Trigger**: User provides feature brief or requests story creation

### 2. task-enhancer.md
- **Before**: `Task enhancement specialist. Researches codebase and adds technical context to tasks. Use after project-manager creates initial tasks.`
- **After**: `Task enhancement specialist. Researches codebase and adds technical context to tasks. Use PROACTIVELY after project-manager creates tasks to add technical context.`
- **Trigger**: After project-manager creates tasks

### 3. coder.md
- **Before**: `Implementation specialist for coding tasks. Use for all development work.`
- **After**: `Implementation specialist for coding tasks. Use PROACTIVELY when user requests code implementation, bug fixes, or security fixes.`
- **Trigger**: User requests code implementation, bug fixes, or security fixes

### 4. reviewer.md
- **Before**: `Senior code reviewer. Use after implementation. Checks quality, security, testing.`
- **After**: `Senior code reviewer. Use PROACTIVELY after code changes to review quality, security, and performance.`
- **Trigger**: After code changes

### 5. reviewer-story.md
- **Before**: `Story-level code reviewer. Reviews all tasks in a story before creating PR. Checks cohesion, integration, and completeness. Use proactively after all tasks in a story are complete.`
- **After**: `Story-level code reviewer. Reviews all tasks in a story before creating PR. Use PROACTIVELY when all story tasks are complete and ready for final review.`
- **Trigger**: When all story tasks are complete

### 6. tester.md
- **Before**: `Testing specialist. Generates comprehensive test suites with edge cases.`
- **After**: `Testing specialist. Generates comprehensive test suites with edge cases. Use PROACTIVELY when code lacks tests or test coverage is below 80%.`
- **Trigger**: Code lacks tests or coverage below 80%

### 7. research.md
- **Before**: `Research specialist for documentation and best practices.`
- **After**: `Research specialist for documentation and best practices. Use PROACTIVELY when user mentions unfamiliar technologies or needs documentation.`
- **Trigger**: User mentions unfamiliar technologies or needs documentation

### 8. documentation.md
- **Before**: `Documentation specialist. Generates/updates docs, docstrings, README.`
- **After**: `Documentation specialist. Generates/updates docs, docstrings, README. Use PROACTIVELY when code lacks documentation or README needs updating.`
- **Trigger**: Code lacks documentation or README needs updating

### 9. refactor.md
- **Before**: `Refactoring specialist. Simplifies code while preserving functionality.`
- **After**: `Refactoring specialist. Simplifies code while preserving functionality. Use PROACTIVELY when code has high complexity, duplication, or architecture issues.`
- **Trigger**: Code has high complexity, duplication, or architecture issues

### 10. cleanup.md
- **Before**: `Cleanup specialist. Removes dead code and unused imports.`
- **After**: `Cleanup specialist. Removes dead code and unused imports. Use PROACTIVELY when detecting dead code, unused imports, or stale files.`
- **Trigger**: Detecting dead code, unused imports, or stale files

## Benefits

1. **Automatic Delegation**: Claude can now intelligently route to appropriate agents based on context
2. **Clear Triggers**: Each agent has specific, actionable triggers for when to invoke
3. **Proactive Behavior**: Enables Claude to suggest agent delegation without explicit user commands
4. **Consistent Pattern**: All agents follow the same pattern from Anthropic's best practices
5. **Better UX**: Users get appropriate agents invoked automatically based on their requests

## Implementation Details

- Modified ONLY the `description:` line in YAML frontmatter
- Rest of each agent file remains unchanged
- All triggers are clear, specific, and action-oriented
- Pattern follows Anthropic best practices from RESEARCH_REPORT.md (lines 175-181)

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test feature brief creation triggers project-manager
2. Verify task-enhancer runs after project-manager
3. Confirm coder activates on implementation requests
4. Check reviewer runs after code changes
5. Validate tester triggers on missing test coverage
6. Ensure documentation activates when docs are outdated
