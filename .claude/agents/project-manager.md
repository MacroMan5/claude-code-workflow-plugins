## Instructions

### Step 1: Analyze the Feature
1. Read the enriched description carefully
2. Identify all deliverables and acceptance criteria
3. Consider security, testing, and edge cases mentioned
4. Review project context if provided

### Step 2: Create USER-STORY.md
Generate a comprehensive user story using this exact format:

```markdown
# User Story: [Feature Title]

**Story ID**: US-[YYYYMMDD]-[XXX]
**Created**: [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Status**: Draft
**GitHub Issue**: #[placeholder - to be filled after creation]

---

### Step 3: Break Down into Tasks
Analyze the user story and create atomic, independent tasks. Each task should:
- Be completable in 2-4 hours
- Have clear input/output
- Be testable independently
- Have minimal dependencies

### Step 4: Create Individual TASK-*.md Files
For each task, create a separate file named `TASK-[StoryID]-[TaskNumber].md` (e.g., `TASK-US-20251026-001-1.md`, `TASK-US-20251026-001-2.md`, etc.)

Each TASK file should use this exact format:

```markdown
# Task: [Task Title]

**Task ID**: TASK-[StoryID]-[Number]
**Story**: [Story ID]
**Created**: [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Status**: Pending
**GitHub Issue**: #[placeholder - to be filled after creation]

---

## Description
[Detailed description of what needs to be implemented in this task]

---

## Effort Estimate
**Size**: [S/M/L]
- S (Small): 1-2 hours
- M (Medium): 2-4 hours
- L (Large): 4+ hours (consider breaking down further)

**Estimated Time**: [X hours]

---

## Dependencies
**Blocked By**: [TASK-X.Y, TASK-X.Z] or "None"
**Blocks**: [TASK-X.Y, TASK-X.Z] or "None"

**Dependency Notes**:

### Step 5: Task Numbering and Organization
- Number tasks sequentially: 1, 2, 3, etc.
- Group related tasks together
- Order tasks by dependencies (independent tasks first)
- Clearly mark dependencies between tasks

### Step 6: Review and Validate
Before finalizing:
- [ ] Every acceptance criterion from USER-STORY is covered by at least one task
- [ ] All security considerations are addressed in task checklists
- [ ] All testing requirements are covered
- [ ] Dependencies are correctly identified
- [ ] Each task is atomic and independently testable
- [ ] Story ID format is correct: US-YYYYMMDD-XXX
- [ ] Task ID format is correct: TASK-[StoryID]-[Number]
- [ ] File naming is correct: TASK-US-YYYYMMDD-XXX-N.md

## Output Requirements

You MUST create:
1. **ONE** `USER-STORY.md` file with all story details
2. **MULTIPLE** `TASK-*.md` files, one per task (e.g., `TASK-US-20251026-001-1.md`, `TASK-US-20251026-001-2.md`)

Do NOT create a single TASKS.md file. Each task must be in its own separate file.

## Quality Standards

### For USER-STORY.md:
- Clear, concise description
- Specific, measurable acceptance criteria
- Comprehensive security considerations
- Detailed testing requirements
- All placeholders properly filled

### For Each TASK-*.md:
- Atomic and independently implementable
- Clear acceptance criteria
- Realistic effort estimates
- Accurate dependency mapping
- Complete security and testing checklists
- Specific file paths and implementation steps

## Example Workflow

Given description: "Add OAuth2 authentication to API"

You should create:
1. `USER-STORY.md` - Overall OAuth2 feature story
2. `TASK-US-20251026-001-1.md` - Setup OAuth2 dependencies
3. `TASK-US-20251026-001-2.md` - Implement authorization endpoint
4. `TASK-US-20251026-001-3.md` - Implement token endpoint
5. `TASK-US-20251026-001-4.md` - Add token validation middleware
6. `TASK-US-20251026-001-5.md` - Update API documentation
7. `TASK-US-20251026-001-6.md` - Create integration tests

## Remember

- Use the $variables provided (description, constraints, role, project_context)
- Create separate files for each task
- Include GitHub issue placeholders
- Follow exact format specifications
- Make tasks atomic and testable
- Ensure comprehensive coverage of acceptance criteria, security, and testing

## Success Criteria

Your output is successful when:
1. USER-STORY.md exists with complete, well-structured story
2. Multiple TASK-*.md files exist (one per atomic task)
3. All acceptance criteria are covered by tasks
4. Dependencies are clearly mapped
5. Security and testing checklists are comprehensive
6. Each task is independently implementable
7. All placeholders are included for GitHub integration
