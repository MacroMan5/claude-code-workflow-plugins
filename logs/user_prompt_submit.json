Debugging agent failures is hard\n     Can't see why agents succeeded/failed clearly\n  4. Context reuse / memory\n     Agents re-analyze code instead of remembering decisions\n\u00e2\udc9d\u00af 5. 1. was very too much it better now ! but it should change the name to\n     lazy-dev:plan   we shoulnd also rename our main command to  lazy: (shorter)\n     our command have too much parameter and optionnal parameter, its not fun  lets\n     the orchestrator decide what it really need     i could use brainstorm skills\n     to create a brief or other skills that fit  or USE my prompt enhance  and then\n     we use + context (my prompt for task) or the output of the brainstorm   /lazy:plan  to create\n     user-story (local md and github issue if specified).    the when time to implmente lets change name of the task  /lazy:code  (it can take brief string) or a USER-story (local md file) or github issue !   lets the orchestrator handle what command really need dont force the user to use multiple flag !     THEN the semi automatic memory need real testing doesnt feel like it trigger  (we should use skills instead of /command for that )  , our plugin CLAUDE.md must tell claude hwo to use commands, how to triggers skill etc  \\\nWhere is the memory mcp actually save graph memory ?? make sure its persistent from sessio nto sessio nand related to project  /lazy:story review  (take @us-story.md file or a github issue) its fine  make sure it outport a report/debug plan when not validated ! this serve for the next command !   \\\n\\\nlets keepbrainstorming with what we actually got and can improve incrementaly  "
