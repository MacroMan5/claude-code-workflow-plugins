# ‚úÖ FIXED! Installation Now Works

## The Issues Were Fixed

### What Was Wrong:
1. ‚ùå Marketplace name had spaces: "LAZY_DEV Marketplace"
2. ‚ùå Missing `owner` field (had `author` instead)
3. ‚ùå Plugin source was `"."` (needs to start with `"./"`)

### What's Fixed:
1. ‚úÖ Marketplace name is now kebab-case: `"lazy-dev-marketplace"`
2. ‚úÖ Added proper `owner` field with name and email
3. ‚úÖ Plugin source is now: `"./LAZY_DEV"`

## üìã What Changed in Files

### Before (Broken):
```json
{
  "name": "LAZY_DEV Marketplace",  // ‚ùå Has spaces
  "author": "MacroMan5",           // ‚ùå Wrong field
  "plugins": [{
    "source": "."                   // ‚ùå Doesn't start with "./"
  }]
}
```

### After (Fixed):
```json
{
  "name": "lazy-dev-marketplace",  // ‚úÖ Kebab-case
  "owner": {                        // ‚úÖ Correct field
    "name": "MacroMan5",
    "email": "etheroux5@gmail.com"
  },
  "plugins": [{
    "source": "./LAZY_DEV"          // ‚úÖ Starts with "./"
  }]
}
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Error: "Marketplace not found"

```bash
# Use correct marketplace name
/plugin list lazy-dev-marketplace

# Install with marketplace name
/plugin install lazy-dev@lazy-dev-marketplace
```

### Error: "Invalid source path"

# Wait 1-2 minutes and retry
