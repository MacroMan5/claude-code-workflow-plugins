- 3-7 tasks for most features
- Each task is a clear action item
- Mark dependencies when needed
- Estimate: S (1-2h), M (2-4h), L (4h+)

**Quality Focus**:
- Specific, testable acceptance criteria
- Security considerations relevant to the feature
- Testing requirements that match feature complexity
- Technical notes only when helpful
