```

**Workflow Coherence**: ✅ **100% MATCH** between documentation and implementation

### Quality Pipeline Verification

**Documented in README.md:**
```
Format → Lint → Type → Test → PASS → Commit
```

**Implemented in task-exec.md (Phase 3):**
```bash
# Step 1: Format (Black + Ruff)
python scripts/format.py <files>

# Step 2: Lint (Ruff)
python scripts/lint.py <files>

# Step 3: Type Check (Mypy)
python scripts/type_check.py <files>

# Step 4: Test (Pytest)
python scripts/test_runner.py tests/

# Each step blocks if it fails (fail-fast)
```

**Status**: ✅ VERIFIED (but scripts/ directory requirement not explicit in README)

---

## Part 4: Agent Delegation Pattern Verification

### Documented Pattern (CLAUDE.md)

"Context-Based Delegation (Not Variables) - Agents extract context from conversation naturally"

### Actual Implementation (task-exec.md lines 559-656)

```python
# Invoke coder agent explicitly via Task tool
Task(
    prompt=f"""
You are the Coder Agent for LAZY-DEV-FRAMEWORK.

## Task
{task_content}

## Research Context (if available)
{research_context if with_research else "No research requested"}

## Acceptance Criteria
{acceptance_criteria}

## GitHub Issue
{f"Closes #{github_issue}" if github_issue else "N/A"}

## Instructions
1. **Follow TDD**: Write tests FIRST, then implementation
2. Add comprehensive type hints (Python 3.11+)
3. Include docstrings (Google style) for all functions/classes
...
"""
)
```

**Status**: ✅ VERIFIED - Agents receive context via Task tool prompt (Anthropic pattern)

---

## Part 5: Memory System Reality Check

### What MEMORY.md Claims (After Corrections)

```
✅ Detection is automatic (UserPromptSubmit hook)
✅ Guidance is automatic (skill injection)
⚠️ Storage/retrieval requires Claude Code to invoke MCP tools
✅ It's AI-assisted, not fully automatic
```

### What Actually Happens

**File**: `.claude/hooks/user_prompt_submit.py`

```python
# Detection logic (lines 297-362)
ENTITY_MENTION_PATTERN = re.compile(
    r"\b(person|service|repo|dataset|api|team):[\w\-/\.]+",
    re.IGNORECASE
)

hard_triggers = [
    "save to memory",
    "add to memory",
    "memory graph",
    ...
]

# Hook injects Memory Graph skill guidance
# Claude Code then decides whether to invoke mcp__memory__* tools
```

**Status**: ✅ ACCURATE - Semi-automatic, AI-assisted

### What's NOT Automatic

❌ No countdown auto-store (hook doesn't execute MCP tools directly)
❌ No automatic context injection (Claude Code must query)
✅ Hook detects + suggests, Claude Code invokes

**Verdict**: MEMORY.md is now accurate after previous corrections

---

## Part 6: GitHub Integration Verification

### create-feature Command (Step 8)

```bash
# Create Main Story Issue
gh issue create \
  --title "[STORY] {story-title}" \
  --body-file "./project-management/US-STORY/US-{ID}-{name}/US-story.md" \
  --label "user-story,story:US-{ID}" \
  --assignee "@me"

# Create Sub-Issues for Tasks
for each TASK-*.md:
    gh issue create \
      --title "[TASK-{ID}] {task-title}" \
      --body-file "TASK-{ID}.md" \
      --label "task,story:US-{ID},parent:${STORY_ISSUE}" \
      --assignee "@me"
```

**Status**: ✅ MANDATORY (not optional)

### story-review Command (Step 9)

```bash
# Create PR
gh pr create \
  --title "[FEATURE] $story_title" \
  --body-file pr_body_final.md \
  --base "$base_branch" \
  --label "story,automated,reviewed,story:$story_id"

# Close all related issues
gh issue close $story_github_issue --reason completed
for each task:
    gh issue close $task_gh_issue --reason completed
```

**Status**: ✅ AUTOMATIC (if review approved)

**Verdict**: GitHub integration is complete and working as documented

---

## Part 7: Required Documentation Updates

### 1. README.md Clarifications (Non-Breaking)

#### Line 88: Clarify "4 Hooks"

**Current**:
```markdown
**4 Hooks** (automation points)
```

**Proposed**:
```markdown
**4 Hook Types** (10 implementations)
```

**Impact**: Clarification only, no behavior change

#### Line 196-201: Add Scripts Requirement

**Current**:
```markdown
### Quality Pipeline

Every task enforces fail-fast quality checks:
```
Format → Lint → Type → Test → PASS → Commit
```
```

**Proposed**:
```markdown
### Quality Pipeline

Every task enforces fail-fast quality checks:
```
Format → Lint → Type → Test → PASS → Commit
```

**Prerequisites**:
- Scripts: `scripts/format.py`, `scripts/lint.py`, `scripts/type_check.py`, `scripts/test_runner.py`
- Tools: `black`, `ruff`, `mypy`, `pytest` (installed via `uv`)
```

**Impact**: Makes prerequisites explicit

#### Line 217-222: Emphasize Semi-Automatic Memory

**Current**:
```markdown
### Memory System

Automatic persistence of durable facts:
```bash
/lazy memory-graph "service:api owned_by:alice"
# → Stored in MCP Memory, auto-injected in future sessions
```
```

**Proposed**:
```markdown
### Memory System

Semi-automatic persistence of durable facts (AI-assisted):
```bash
# Manual storage
/lazy memory-graph "service:api owned_by:alice"

# Automatic detection + suggestion
# Hooks detect entity mentions → suggest storage → Claude Code invokes MCP tools
# See MEMORY.md for implementation details
```
```

**Impact**: Accurate description of how memory works

### 2. Create Missing SUB_AGENTS.md

**Status**: Referenced in README.md line 420 but file doesn't exist

**Proposed Content**: Create comprehensive agent registry with:
- Agent name, description, tools, model
- When to use each agent
- Input/output format
- Example invocations

**Impact**: Completes documentation set

### 3. Document scripts/ Directory

**Status**: Required by quality pipeline but not documented

**Proposed**: Add `scripts/README.md` explaining:
- `format.py` - Black + Ruff formatting
- `lint.py` - Ruff linting
- `type_check.py` - Mypy type checking
- `test_runner.py` - Pytest with coverage

**Impact**: Makes setup clearer for new users

## Part 8: What Should NOT Be Changed

### ✅ These Are Accurate and Should Stay

1. **"Commit-per-task, PR-per-story"** → ✅ CORRECT
2. **"Quality pipeline mandatory"** → ✅ CORRECT
3. **"TDD required"** → ✅ CORRECT
4. **"Context-based delegation"** → ✅ CORRECT

   - **Impact**: Low (agents are documented in README)
   - **Priority**: Medium
   - **Effort**: 2 hours

2. **scripts/ README** - Quality scripts not documented
   - **Impact**: Medium (users need to know what scripts are required)
   - **Priority**: High
   - **Effort**: 1 hour

3. **Parallel execution examples** - WORKFLOW.md mentions but no examples
   - **Impact**: Low (feature works, just needs examples)
   - **Priority**: Low
   - **Effort**: 30 minutes

### ✅ No Critical Gaps

All core features are implemented and working. Gaps are documentation only.
